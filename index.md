I am a Electric Engineer major transferred to CSUF, and I am hoping to graduate by 2025

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 9 Part 1
I liked this lab because it takes real world scenarios and appies those concepts into a form where we can use them in coding. This code was challenging and fun using multiple for loops and if statements to calculate the average and delete the lowest score. I can also relate this code to other concepts such as figuring out your grade if the professor drops the lowest test score. I now have a code that can do that!

Lab 2 Part 2
This lab was fun to make as this made me feel like a kid again. The strings lab has us code using the #include <string> which plays a major part for this course. This code was simple and fun, even after you can create your own MadLib versions with this code. The use of std::cin and std::string makes the possibilities of this type of lab endless.

Lab 4 Part 1
This lab really tested and intrigued me with the use of multiple files to complete one task. The Unit Conversion lab referenced other documents with multiple functions that at first I found difficult. After completing the lab, my knowledge and interest for coding grew further.
